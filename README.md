## Introduction

## Projects
Currently, there is only one project linked because that's all I've done. I'll gradually add my projects as I complete them. 

My first project included me fixing code that was given to me to consolidate tags and ensuring the html file followed semantics. 

## Issues
Flex box property caused me the most trouble because I had to fully understand where my items were going. I knew what I wanted but it took a great deal of trial and error to make sure everything was aligned. I tried using development tools in Chrome but struggled in that area. I couldn't tell which screen size I was working on so I struggled figuring out where I was. So, I used the web browser and made the window smaller.

Another major issues was making the design responsive. I tried the development tools again and thought I figured it out and the design looked good there but then changing screen size in the browser, I was back at the beginning with it not looking well. 

Color was another issue because I didn't know what to pick. I wanted something that represented who I am but was also professional. I think I could tone it down a bit but I like the color. After I chose the header, I didn't know how to pick colors from the header. So, I found a color scheme picker online where four colors were randomly chosen upon a click. I was given the hex color number. It was very helpful. Another issue was with padding and margins of my navigation bar. It worked but at some point, one clickable content wrapped. Another issue I had was trying to make the image of the project opaque and keep the print of the label at 100% opaque. 

## Insights
What I've learned doing this project:
- Complete the HTML file first
- Take one section at a time to apply CSS
- When troubleshooting, comment out all other sections and gradually add in elements/features to see how the page changes

## Future Plans
I would like to add a link so when it's mobile friendly, when the user/viewer clicks on my phone number, they can call directly. I will add more projects as I complete them.
