## Introduction

## Projects

## Issues
My biggest issue was color. I didn't know what colors matched what so I found a scheme picker online where four colors were randomly chosen upon a click and they worked together. I was given the hex color number. It was very helpful. Another issue was with padding and margins of my navigation bar. It worked but at some point, one clickable content wrapped. Another issue I had was trying to make the image of the project opaque and keep the print of the label at 100% opaque. 

## Future Plans
I would like to add a link so when it's mobile friendly, when the user/viewer clicks on my phone number, they can call directly. I will add more projects as I complete them.
